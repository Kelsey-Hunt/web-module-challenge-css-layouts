        <h2>My Web Development Journey</h2>
        <h3 class="'bold">An Eye for Aesthetic...</h3><p>Since childhood, I have chased fulfillment through the unique feeling of accomplishment and joy that only comes through creating something new with my own two hands. Throughout my life, I have nurtured my love for design through a wide-variety of art forms including starting my own stained glass studio, designing and refinishing furniture, and adorning my wardrobe with custom embroidery.</p><br>
        <h3 class="bold">Leveraging Technology to Optimize Life...</h3><p>My strategy for tackling life's challenges has always been "Work hard now so you can relax later." Throughout my career (and at home) I am constantly seeking ways to streamline the process for any task I don't enjoy doing. My interest in web development grew from my appreciation of a well-designed spreadsheet and the efficiency that can be achieved by spending the time to create one. However, after creating a spreadsheet for each of my most dreaded tasks, I have come to terms with the fact that there is only so much that can be achieved through Excel.</p><br>
        <h3 class="bold">Launching a New Career...</h3><p>I enrolled at BloomTech in 2022 to pursue a career that supports the interests I have developed personally and professionally. Upon graduation, I look forward to designing aesthetically pleasing platforms backed with limitless optimization tools.</p>
